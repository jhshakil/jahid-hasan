        <p>
          Hello! I'm John Doe, a passionate full-stack web developer with over 5
          years of experience in creating robust and scalable web applications.
          My journey in tech started when I built my first website at the age of
          15, and I've been hooked ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in JavaScript technologies, particularly React and
          Node.js. I'm also experienced with TypeScript, Next.js, and various
          database technologies. My approach to development is to write clean,
          maintainable code that solves real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source
          projects, writing technical blog posts, or exploring the latest web
          technologies. I'm always eager to learn and grow, both as a developer
          and as a person.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently open to new opportunities where I can contribute my
          skills and continue to learn. If you think we'd be a good fit, don't
          hesitate to get in touch!
        </p>
      </div>
